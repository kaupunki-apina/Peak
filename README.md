# Peak

Peak is an Android Client which uses [JourneysAPI](http://wiki.itsfactory.fi/index.php/Journeys_API) to display real time information of TKL buses.

## Setup
The only setup app requires is setting a valid GoogleMap API key as a `String` resource naming it `google_maps_key`. You may learn more about acquiring a key [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup).
